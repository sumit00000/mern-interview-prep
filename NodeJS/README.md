## 🎯 Goal

This section is designed to build strong backend fundamentals and make you confident in Node.js for real-world development and technical interviews.

---

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Review the external resources to understand the core concepts and common questions.
2. Build small examples using Express, middleware, routing, and APIs.
3. Practice debugging, performance tuning, and applying security best practices.
4. Combine this with JavaScript knowledge and database skills for full MERN-stack confidence.

## 🚀 Next Steps

After completing Node.js basics, continue exploring:

- **Asynchronous JavaScript in Node**: Callbacks, Promises, `async/await`
- **Streams and Buffers**: For handling large file operations
- **Cluster Module & Worker Threads**: For scaling and performance
- **REST APIs with Express**: CRUD, middleware, error handling
- **Security**: Input validation, Helmet, rate limiting
- **Testing**: Using Jest, Supertest, Postman
- **Authentication**: JWT, OAuth2
- **Advanced Topics**: Caching, message queues, background jobs
