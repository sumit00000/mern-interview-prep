## 🎯 Goal

This section is designed to build strong backend fundamentals and make you confident in MongoDB for real-world development and technical interviews.

---

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Review the external resources to understand the core concepts and common questions.
2. Build small examples using MongoDB's shell or a Node.js application with Mongoose.
3. Practice CRUD operations, aggregation pipelines, indexing strategies, and replication setups.
4. Combine this with JavaScript and Node.js knowledge for full MERN-stack confidence.

## 🚀 Next Steps

After completing MongoDB basics, continue exploring:

- **Data Modeling**: Embedding vs. referencing documents
- **Aggregation Framework**: `$match`, `$group`, `$lookup`, etc.
- **Indexing**: Single-field, compound, and geospatial indexes
- **Replication**: Setting up replica sets for high availability
- **Sharding**: Distributing data across multiple servers
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and encryption
- **Performance Optimization**: Query optimization and profiling
