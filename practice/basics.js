1. What is Node.js?

Node.js is a free, open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 engine. 
It is designed for creating servers and web applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, 
which makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.
